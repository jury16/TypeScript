Create a Scales project.<br>
Develop a Scales class that has:<br>
- an array of Products added to the scales (objects of the Product class);<br>
- add method for adding a new Product to the scale;<br>
- getSumScale method for getting the total weight of the added Products;<br>
- getNameList method to get a list of the names of the added Products in the form of an array.<br>

Products added by the add method (objects of the Product class) must have getScale and getName methods.<br>
Develop at least two different product classes (for example, Apple and Tomato) that inherit the getScale and getName methods from Product.<br>

Create an object of the Libra class.<br>
Create several objects of classes Apple, Tomato, etc. with different names and weights, add them to the scales, display the result of the getSumScale and getNameList methods to the console.
